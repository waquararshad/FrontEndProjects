    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is the main characteristic of reactive dyes?",
    "options": [
      "They require high temperature",
      "They form covalent bonds with fiber",
      "They work only in acidic conditions",
      "They are water-insoluble"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Reactive dyes form permanent covalent chemical bonds with the fiber molecules, resulting in excellent wash fastness."

    "id": 8,
    "question": "Which natural fiber has the highest moisture absorption capacity?",
    "options": [
      "Cotton",
      "Wool",
      "Silk",
      "Linen"

  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "What is the purpose of using salt in reactive dyeing?",
    "options": [
      "To adjust pH",
      "To promote dye exhaustion",
      "To prevent dye fixation",
      "To reduce temperature"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Salt promotes dye exhaustion by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between anionic dye molecules and negatively charged cellulose fibers."
